# FIRST LEVEL REQUIREMENTS  
  
## CONCEPT ART  
  
### MAINSTREAM MARK  
  
An average American teenager dressed in street clothes. Should have three different outfits and hairstyles.

### SKELETON ARM  
  
A skeleton arm that bursts out of the ground.

## ANIMATIONS  
  
### MAINSTREAM MARK  
  
#### HAPPY STRUT

![](Attachments/strut_2.gif)  
  
#### SLOW TURN  
  
Change direction while walking. The character's left leg and foot in the below animation is too stiff.  
  
![](Attachments/walk_turn.gif)  
  
#### RUNNING AND SCREAMING  
  
Arms are up and flailing. This should probably be split in half. The first half is starting to run while screaming, and the end is running while not screaming.

#### QUICK TURN  
  
Change direction while running. The animation below is not great, but it is the general idea.

### SKELLY ARM  
  
#### ANIMATION - GROUND POP  
  
The arm should start out buried under a pile of dirt, and pop out of the ground.

#### ANIMATION - THUMBS UP  
  
![](Attachments/200w%202.gif)  
  
## ENVIRONMENT  
  
### NAUSOLEUM INTERIOR BACKGROUND  
  
Should look like the interior of a mausoleum.

![](Attachments/project_1_en-20240925094618316.webp)  
  
### NORMAL FLOOR TILE  
  
The floor is currently 9 tiles by 3 tiles. I would like to make this taller -- 5 tiles tall, which means the tiles might need to be smaller or of a different perspective.

![](Attachments/project_1_en-20240925092453205.webp)  
  
### EXPAND FLOOR TILE/ICON  
  
Should either be a variation on the tile or an icon that clearly communicates more floor is being built.

### ENTER/EXIT DOOR  
  
![](Attachments/door_a%201.png)  
  
## UI  
  
- Simple  
- Easy to read  
- Icons are currently white with a transparent background  
  
### GAME WORLD  
  
#### SCREAM ICON  
  
Generated when a guest screams. Floats around the level until the player clicks it.

### SIDEBAR  
  
#### SCREAM COUNTER ICON  
  
![](Attachments/project_1_en-20240925210914455.webp)  
  
#### SKELETON ARM ICON  
  
Dragging and dropping the skeleton arm icon onto a tile deploys the skeleton arm.  
  
![](Attachments/skeleton_arm-chip%201.png)  
  
#### RECALL ICON  
  
Clicking the recall icon removes the undertaker (in this case the skeleton arm) from the game world.
