<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>[[Nausoleum</td>
      <td>Nausoleum]] is a haunted house simulator about entertaining the [[Guests</td>
      <td>Guests]] of a haunted house. Players are introduced as its new [[The Curator</td>
      <td>The Curator]].</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Players recruit [[Undertakers</td>
      <td>Undertakers]] to entertain Guests, who enthusiastically encourage them to experience a variety of strong emotions. Entertaining Guests is a delightful puzzle, as Guests have their own sensibilities, and naturally avoid strong emotions. The resulting noises and bodily fluids are captured and used as resources to upgrade Undertakers, the Nausoleum, and Curator abilities.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h1 id="winning-and-losing">WINNING AND LOSING</h1>

<h2 id="long-term">LONG-TERM</h2>

<p>The player has two long-term goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Maximize the [[Nausoleum/Docs/Design/Curator/Prestige</td>
          <td>Prestige]] of the Nausoleum</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Choose one of several [[Patrons</td>
          <td>Patrons]] of the house to align with and fulfill their wishes</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="short-term">SHORT-TERM</h2>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Levels of the game are divided into floors. Each floor corresponds with one of the [[Puzzles</td>
      <td>Puzzles]] and at least one of the [[Player Challenges</td>
      <td>Player Challenges]]. Winning or losing a specific floor occurs by increasing or decreasing [[Nausoleum/Docs/Design/Guests/Guest Satisfaction</td>
      <td>Guest Satisfaction]] above or below a certain threshold given certain constraints.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h1 id="gameplay">GAMEPLAY</h1>

<p>The main game board size varies, but will always have an entrance square and exit square.</p>

<p>Guests have their own internal priorities and pathing, but they are unaware of how to increase their own satisfaction.</p>

<h2 id="player-strategies">PLAYER STRATEGIES</h2>

<p>To maximize Prestige, the player needs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entertain the guest via fear, disgust, or laughter</li>
  <li>Delay the guest’s exit</li>
  <li>Choose and effectively use consumables and renovations</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="design-pillars">DESIGN PILLARS</h1>

<h2 id="consistently-fair">CONSISTENTLY FAIR</h2>

<p>Players should never feel cheated because of some hidden game state. Ensure that the game is as challenging as possible while remaining achievable.</p>

<h2 id="approachable">APPROACHABLE</h2>

<p>The game should be easy to pick up, but difficult to master.</p>

<h2 id="emergent-complexity">EMERGENT COMPLEXITY</h2>

<p>Core systems are simple but complexity builds naturally through a variety of interactions.</p>

<h2 id="always-challenging">ALWAYS CHALLENGING</h2>

<p>This is not a cozy game. we want to push the player to succeed.</p>

<h2 id="spooky--disgusting">SPOOKY &amp; DISGUSTING</h2>

<p>We’re not looking for realism. we’re not looking to provoke actual fear in the player; only the characters. On the other hand, characters will puke,be maimed, eaten, dismembered, or have the blood drained out of them. Think Binding of Isaac but less poop.</p>

<h2 id="visceral">VISCERAL</h2>

<p>When it comes to violence, don’t be shy, but also don’t be rediculous. More Fallout / than Mortal Kombat.</p>

<h2 id="comically-dark">COMICALLY DARK</h2>

<h2 id="squishy-ui">SQUISHY UI</h2>

<p>The UI should be fun and pliable. Think Balatro or Super Mario 64’s pullable Mario head. It should also respond with appropriate sounds to user actions.</p>

<h2 id="experience-is-king">EXPERIENCE IS KING</h2>

<p>THE ENTIRE experience SHOULD BE A POLISHED, cohesive WHOLE. THE FINISHED PRODUCT WILL NOT CONTAIN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES.</p>
